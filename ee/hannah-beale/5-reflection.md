## Reflection Week 5

#### What did I do well this week?

Last week, I rushed through a lot of the coursework in order to finish on time. While observing deadlines is important and often necessary, this week I really wanted to take the time to absorb as much of the weeks work as I could. In many cases this meant going back of previous coursework in order to understand/cement concepts. I think this has been beneficial. I tried not to stress about the amount of time I was taking per assignment with in reason.


#### What could I have done to improve?

I really need work on translating my thought process into a the simple, logical pattern that javascript requires. It is a lot of fun when I finally get something right and the amount of time it takes me to get there is often the result of starting with a very complicated thought and trying to write code for it. An alternative that works better for me is reducing the thought to its logical bones and then once that code is working I can build out from there.

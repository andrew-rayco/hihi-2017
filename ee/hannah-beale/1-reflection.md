## Reflection

#### **Why is reflection important?**

Reflection encourages personal growth, empathetic growth and memory growth. It is an aspect of spaced repetition in which returning to a concept or idea multiple times over a specific period allows your brain to retain it better.

#### What did I do well this week?

This week I think I have done a good job of knowing when to temporarily leave an issue and come back with fresh eyes instead of getting frustrated. I have tried to note concepts which are important to come back to later on instead of falling down the rabbit hole at the time.

#### What could I have done to improve?

 I could have mapped out my plan of attack at the start of the week instead of jumping from one assignment to the next. I didn't really participate in any of the Slack discussions or contribute which is something I want to get more comfortable with doing.

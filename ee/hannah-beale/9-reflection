## Reflection Week 9


#### What did I do well this week?
The last few days have been a blur of trying to make up time lost in the last few weeks.



#### What could I have done to improve?
I have just been focusing on doing what I can and not giving in to the sense that I've bitten off far more than I can chew. Going forward I need to remind myself that I am committed to graduating bootcamp and doing the experience justice. I just have to remember to use the new skills I've gained to make sure I'm checking in with myself regularly and practicing emotional resilience.

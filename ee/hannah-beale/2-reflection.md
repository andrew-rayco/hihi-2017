##Reflection Week 2

####What did I do well this week?

This week I managed my time much better by working out a basic schedule at the beginning of the week and mostly sticking to it. I made sure to timebox tasks so as to keep on track. Also, I made time to keep practicing and solidifying the basics of html and css as well as the new material.

####What could I have done to improve?

I want to be a bit bolder with trying out new code on my website. At the moment, I am a bit don't fix it if it ain't broke which is not constructive. So I will make duplicates and mess around with some new ideas.

## Reflection Week 5

#### What did I do well this week?

I was aiming to reduce the effects of my frustration when I got blocked. I tried to reframe what I
saw as failure as opportunities to try a different perspective which helped keep me level-headed enough to be productive. I also really worked on understanding each element of code I was writing and why which, in the long run, helped with writing certain functions.



#### What could I have done to improve?
I still want to work on finishing up the main assignments earlier on in the week. My personal life has been a bit hectic recently and I think I've been subconsciously using it as an excuse to slack off on my preferred pace. I definitely did better this week, finishing on Saturday instead on Sunday night/Monday morning. And with extra time at the end of the week I'm hoping to focus on some stretch goals and quickly redo my website using Bootstrap.

## Reflection Week 3

#### What did I do well this week?

This week I approached problems with a much better attitude, managing to not get as impractically frustrated like previous weeks.

#### What could I have done to improve?

My time management as usual. I started the week off with a lot of momentum but by the middle of the week when life got in the way I really tailed off. My goal for next week is not be rushing to finish on Sunday. Now, after all the crash learning from this week, I want to go back and really get to grips with some of the content.

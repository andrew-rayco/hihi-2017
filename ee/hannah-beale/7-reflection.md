##Reflection Week 7

####What did I do well this week?
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get much done this week.



####What could I have done to improve?
I was really anxious about falling behind and put myself through a lot of unnecessary stress that just made everything feel a lot more overwhelming. So in future, if this type of situation reoccurs I just need to be pragmatic about what I'm able to do and be a bit more compassionate to myself.

Why is reflection important?
  I believe reflection is important to identify both what you are doing well on in the course, as well as recognizing what you need to improve on as the course progresses. If you ignore what needs improvement, especially in such a fast-paced course, you will fall behind very quickly. At the same time, it's important to recognize what you're doing right, and be proud of the work you have achieved!

What did I do well this week?
  This week I became comfortable with navigating the command line using basic commands. I actually really enjoy using it. I have also become comfortable with screwing up my code. Ok, that's probably not the best way to put it. I'm starting to learn how to problem-solve. When my code isn't working, I have to find the solution, and when I do, it feels like the ultimate victory!

What could I have done to improve?
  Time management! While working on my CSS for my blog, I wasted a lot of time just looking up images and other less important things, when I should have been focusing on perfecting the code. I'll have to spend more time on that in the coming weeks.

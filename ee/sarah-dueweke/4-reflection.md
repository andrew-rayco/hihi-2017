What did you do well this week?

I think my greatest accomplishment this week was managing my time well for each task. In past weeks, I've started out strong on Monday, and then did too much at once so by the end of the week I was completely fading out. This week I made a game plan and gave myself specific tasks to do each day, to spread the work out more evenly. It made me feel a bit more organized.

What could I have improved on?

Mostly I just know I need to practice using Javascript more. It's a tricky language, and though some aspects of it I was able to understand, others I found very difficult. I will need to kick the logical side of my brain into gear to get a better handle of how JS works.

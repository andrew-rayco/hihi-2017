Week 8 Reflection

What did I do well this week?
What could I have done to improve?

This week I felt neither particularly successful nor unsuccessful in my learning. I think some of the learning resources I was using for the calculator assignment sent me in circles a little, because there are so many different ways to get a computer to do the same thing. I can always improve by practicing writing more code.

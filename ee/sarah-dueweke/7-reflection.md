Week 7 Reflection

What did I do well this week?

This week I felt I did well on problem-solving in javascript. The paired programming assignment was great for practicing problem-solving techniques and learning how other people work. I am slowly becoming more confident in my abilities with computer-logic.

What could I have done to improve?

I need to continue to work on improving my patience with coding. The further down the list of algorithm problems I got, the shorter my attention span became, especially when I got really stuck on a problem. Practicing mindfulness more may help me with this.

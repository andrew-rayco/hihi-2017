Sprint 5 Reflection

What did I do well this week?
  This week was a tough one for me. My aim is not just to complete the assignments and get them over with, I want to really understand everything that is going on in the code. Usually, I don't understand it the first time through, so forcing myself to do an assignment a second or third time until the information sinks in has been helpful. That much I've done well at... just making myself repeat the work until it makes more sense.

What could use improvement?
  My patience with problem-solving. I get fed up pretty quickly with code that isn't working, and I end up staring at the screen in frustration. I need to practice problem-solving techniques more and remind myself that even really amazing coders get stuck sometimes and take a lot of time to figure out a problem.

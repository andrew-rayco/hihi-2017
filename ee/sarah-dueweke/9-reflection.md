What did I do well through my 9 weeks of Phase 0?

Like many who sign up for EDA, I quite surprised myself early on in Bootcamp. The fact that I am learning (and enjoying) working in tech has itself been a huge surprise. And the idea that I might some day be competent enough at it to make it a career is a very exciting prospect. I felt that I did well at keeping my stress levels at bay, and trying to be kind to myself during the learning process. Of course, this wasn't always the case, but I did my best to remind myself that we're learning a lot in a small amount of time, and I shouldn't beat myself up if I don't get something right away.

My confidence in my coding abilities has been a roller coaster. Joseph told us once that the highs and lows of coding tend to be extreme, and I definitely felt that. There were days that I'd get some code to work, and thought, Oh my god this must be my calling, I can't believe I'm getting it! And other days when I felt like I had no idea what I was doing, nothing was working, and I would ask myself why I was even there. It's amazing how emotional coding can be. But the moments I found the most fun and exciting were when I was working with my fellow Hihis and we solved a problem together. Sharing the joy of building something that works is an incredible experience. It makes all the coding "lows" worth it.


What could I have done to improve?

I always think I can be more disciplined with my study. This is where I struggle with teaching myself. I need structure to motivate me to study more. When left to my own devices, I can become lazy. I'd finish all of the assignments we needed to do, but didn't always use the time leftover to practice more, when I should have. This is why I am looking forward to bootcamp so much. I thrive in a busy work environment, and I think I'm the most productive when there is a lot to do.

Phase 0, Week 2 Reflection

What did I do well this week?

  This week I got a better handle on writing neater code. When we first started building our websites last week, I just threw all of the code into a html and css files, without much organization. After learning about best practices for these, I wanted to go back, burn all that original code to the ground, and start over! I didn't quite do that, but I re-wrote most of it into slightly neater code. I'll definitely want to keep working at organizing everything into clean, easy to read code.

What could I have done to improve?

  I was glad to get some practice with github in this week, but it is something I will need to work at more to get a firmer grasp on all of the git commands. I'd also like to practice flex-boxing more so that I can use it in my website to make a cleaner, better design. I'm no designer, and I'm finding it frustrating trying to make my website look really nice, when I don't really have much talent for the artistic side of things.

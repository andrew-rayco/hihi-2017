Sprint 6 Reflection

What did I do well this week?
This week I felt I was really beginning to understand how to read javascript. I still struggle with being able to write code on my own, from scratch, but a few weeks ago I would have opened up a JS file and thought it all looked like complete jibberish. Now, when I read JS code, I actually know what a lot of it is doing. I wouldn't have been able to write all of that minesweeper by myself (not by a long shot), but when I read through the lib.js I understood what it was all doing. Which to me felt pretty good.

What could I have done to improve?
I need to work on being more disciplined on doing extra study. Often, when I finish the assignments for the week, I think, Oh good, now I have more time to study eloquent js or codeacademy stuff! But I don't put in nearly as much time as I could. Or, I work on code that is more fun, but I don't necessarily need to study. I think that will all change when bootcamp starts and I have no choice but to spend all my time working!

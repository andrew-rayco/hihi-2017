Week 3 Reflection:

What did I do well this week?

This week I feel I did well at small problem-solving. When I encountered issues in building my initial navigation bar, I was able to figure out what was wrong, make adjustments, and learn more about CSS properties along the way. I also started to feel better about styling in a grid system and using Skeleton to design my website.


What could I have done to improve?

While my initial navigation bar worked out the way I wanted it to, once I tried adjusting it to be responsive, I went down many deep and cavernous rabbit holes. I really struggled to understand the code behind CSS mobile navbars. I didn't want to just copy and paste one from a website just so I would have one, I wanted to understand why the code does what it does. So while I still do not have a fully responsive page, I am slowly trying to learn how the code works. Sloooooowly.

So excited that Phase 0 is almost over!! Although I little worried about what is to come in the next 9 weeks. I feel as though the last 9 weeks have flown by and I think I got to about week 5 before I started to lose motivation for self-directed study. I really enjoyed the first few weeks (although I'm saying that in hindsight when in fact, during the time I felt very stressed). I enjoyed the html and css work and building my website. The later weeks felt a little less structured and I came to realise that I need structure to learn well. I've found googling quite helpful in moving forward but also sometimes really overwhelming as there is so much I don't understand. I also find it frustrating that there are so many different ways to achieve the same outcome with coding. I'm really glad that I kept on top of the assignments every week otherwise I think my stress levels would have been through the roof. Going into EDA from time to time was also really helpful - great to build early relationships with other cohort peeps but also to bounce ideas and share similar frustrations made me realise that the challenges I was facing were universal. If I had to do it all over again, I might have tried to do some coding before starting phase 0.

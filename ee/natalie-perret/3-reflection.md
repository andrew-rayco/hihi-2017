Once I figured out how the skeleton framework worked I was able to use html and css to create the website I had envisaged with a few elements still missing. I probably didn't spend enough time on html and css last week so I was in catch up mode a bit this week. I learnt a lot about patience and resilience and hope that I can take this forward for the rest of phase-0 when I'm sure things are going to get trickier. I also need to learn to use Toggl better - I often forget to turn it on and then leave it running during my breaks.

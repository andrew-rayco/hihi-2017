Reflection is important to me because it provides me with an opportunity to consider what I did well and what I can improve on.
I started off the week a bit overwhelmed, but printed out the Sprint 1 guide and all my assignments (old school) and broke it down step by step and did what I could and built on that each time.
Coding is my priority this week and I'm putting more time aside to stay on track.

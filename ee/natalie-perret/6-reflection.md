This week I learnt how to use other people's code and adapt it to suit my needs. Not ideal, but the only way I know how to move forward using JS at the moment. While I generally understand the concepts (or formulas if you will) however I struggle with figuring out where to start. But I figure, something must have seeped in as I was still able to adapt other people's code to do what I wanted it to do. Also, I created the reset button all by myself (if you don't count Google...)

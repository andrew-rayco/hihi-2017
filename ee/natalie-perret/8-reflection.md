This week, I tried to get on top of the assignments early in the week but wasn't really motivated by the tasks. I found the calculator task difficult as I didn't know where to start and found the guidance unhelpful. I know I need to spend more time getting my head around the key concepts of JS and to spend more time practisiing for the sake of practising and not worrying about the end product.

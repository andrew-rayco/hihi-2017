What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?  
I think I did a good job at the technical side. I found it super easy to get motivated about the coding and I really enjoyed all of those assignments. I think I did a good job at time management, except for putting off the cultural blogs.  
What could I have done to improve?  
I think I could have made more of an effort with the cultural blogs and creating good habits I don't think I'm super prepared for 9 weeks full time

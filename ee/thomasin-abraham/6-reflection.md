What did I do well this week?  
This week I did a good job of completing the biggest assignment early (minesweeper), which left the rest of the week free and gave me lots of time to experiment and play around with it. I loved how many new things I learned! I feel like I really brought 100% this week (-:  
What could I have done to improve?  
I didn't get around to meditating because I had my head in a computer all of my spare time. I did so well with meditating last week because I finished everything early and there were no extensions I could really do or tangents I could go off on so I had lots of free time but this week I was playing around with the minesweeper code the whole week. I wish I'd got some minutes in and next week I want to make it a priority.

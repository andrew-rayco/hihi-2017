What did I do well this week?  
This week I managed my time really well and it gave me the opportunity to work on my mindfulness - I managed to get in over 20 minutes of meditation which is 20 minutes more than other week. I found a nice app for guided meditations that have mindful breathing and body scans like the Search Inside Yourself book.  
What could I have done to improve?  
I think I shouldn't have just finished the assignments then forgotten about the work, I think I should have spent more time going back over the assignments, playing around, trying to get the code more concise etc... Although I did spend the extra time motivating myself for the mindfulness aspect which is also important, I think I could have spent more time on the technical part.

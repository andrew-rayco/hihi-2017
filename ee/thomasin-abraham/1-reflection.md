Why is reflection important?
Reflection is important because it enables you to pause, rushing through reflection I've found tends to cause you to prioritise the negative aspects of what you've done and what you haven't managed to accomplish. Pausing and giving yourself time to reflect enables you to focus on the good things and the meaningful things you've accomplished as well as what you could have done better.It's an effective way to grow and learn and push yourself.
What did I do well this week?
I think I did a good job of prioritising and even in the assignments where I was tempted to go an extra, unnecessary mile pulling myself back. Focusing on time management over going down long rabbit holes, which I've always struggled with.
What could I have done to improve?
I didn't really contribute to any discussions, or succeed in using the time and habits techniques day to day. Next week to improve I think I'll set a reminder every day and really push myself into contributing even if I'm not 100% confident about it.

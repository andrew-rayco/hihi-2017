What did I do well this week?  
I made it into the office for the pair programming which was fun and I think I really absorbed the material it made me feel more confident about what I know.  
What could I have done to improve?  
I felt a bit burned out this week and I didn't do many hours or feel super motivated so I probably needed to give myself a bit more time and maybe not push myself so much so I have more stamina (:

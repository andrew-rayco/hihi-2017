What did I do well this week?  
This week I think I did a good job of perservering even though it hasn't been the best week. I wasn't really feeling motivated or engaged but I still made my best effort at the work and assignments which I was really proud of myself for.  
What could I have done to improve?  
Put more thought into being aware of what I was doing and what I was trying to achieve instead of treating the work like a checklist. I didn't succeed at really embracing the learning process, it was definitely product over process which was a big disappointment for me. This showed in my commits, which I got frustrated with and neglected/bad commit messages, And toggl which I also forgot or left running too long half the time. Next week I want to focus on learning, and giving 100%.

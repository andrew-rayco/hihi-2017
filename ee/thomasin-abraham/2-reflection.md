What did I do well this week?  
This week I think I did a good job of making it through assignments I didn't have a lot of passion or motivation for, like the design elements and video tutorials which are both things I struggle to enjoy. I was proud of myself for perservering and getting through them.  
What could I have done to improve?  
I think I could have had better time management. I didn't start work until Thursday and although I still got everything done, with a bigger workload I would have struggled this weekend. I also need to get better at organisation and making time for mindfulness and healthy habits like meditation and stretching.

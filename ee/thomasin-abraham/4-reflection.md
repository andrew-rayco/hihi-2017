What did I do well this week?  
This week I felt so much more balanced and content than I have recently. I didn't feel very inspired by the assignments but I did enjoy revising and I was proud of the way I set aside time to finish them off. I feel like I have a much better understanding of Javascript now and I loved researching the answers for the technical blog!  
What could I have done to improve?  
I think it's important to make sure I think less about what I need to do and what I haven't done, and more about what I have and what progress I've made towards my goals.

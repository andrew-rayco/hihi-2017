Something that I did well was realise this week that I am unable to work at my intensive hospitality job and be able to commit myself wholeheartedly into this course at the same time. As a result I have handed in my resignation! Powerful stuff! I am so looking excited to commit my energy and effort to building a strong foundation for bootcamp.


 What I could have improved upon was working through Udacity a lot quicker to then research a little deeper how these new concepts function. I haven't grasped the ideas of flex, how to use bootstraps or even tool grips. Im keep a list of the concepts to revise.

Reflection is important for taking a moment to check in with yourself and see what worked
you and what could do with some improvement. It how we make improvements and
identify where we might need extra help.

I did well in enjoying myself through the tasks! I was a little worried about how
I would handle some of the problem solving situations and become frustrated in the process.
I however kept breathing and just pushed through the confusion to feeling like I have a good grasp on
the basic concepts of command line, Git and Github, and the very beginnings of HTML & CSS.

Better time management is required as we move onwards. I want to secure myself a solid foundation
and each week as we move onwards this will become more and more challenging if I am not better
structured with my time. Balancing work, study and down time will be a challenge for me. I can imagine many people in
my cohort are the same.

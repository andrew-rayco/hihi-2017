What did I do well this week?
This week was a difficult week, in tackling the minesweeper challenge. I did well to NOT feed the monsters and to persevere with the task. My logic is improving and understanding of JS code! Amazing looking back on the week of code camp and now. Where will I be this time next week?

What could I improve upon?
Resist looking at others code to solve a problem, rather pseudocode it out a heck of a lot more and do google searches to solve the logic and provide some syntax help. This is my goal for next week, take more ownership of my code.

What did I do well this week?
I started the week with a great attitude to sink my teeth into the coming tasks.
I made time to complete tasks are review the weeks work.
I made time to revise Sprint -4 doing JS free code camp to reiterate concepts.



What could I have done to improve?
In some of the more difficult problems I didn't use all my resources to solve the problem by myself. Instead I got the solution which really feels like a cop out and takes the satisfaction of problem solving away. This is my biggest area of improvement that ill make my best effort to improve for next week.

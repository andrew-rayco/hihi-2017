What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

The past nine weeks of Phase 0 have felt like they passed at lightening speed and snail pace slow all at once. SO much learning has been jammed into these weeks that my brain has been jumbled up and spit out (more than a few times) to understand new concepts and ways of thinking.
I am proud of my commitment and perseverance through the tough times of learning (I am well aware these are not over for me yet) and really digging deep to keep positive.
I have made some great friends within my cohort, this camaraderie has been the strongest tool.
Looking back to day one, when I was learning about the scary black box we know as the command line, the learning curve have been incredible. I am impressed at how far I have come in such a short time.
I have applied Mr Meng's mindfulness practices to everyday life as well as life as a baby dev. Search Inside yourself is a life changing book, I'll be reading it again.
My touch typing skills have improved dramatically in the last 9 weeks, which makes typing so much more enjoyable than before.
I am able to hold some interesting techie conversations now and find myself getting really excited about problem solving and creating things in JS!
To think that 3 and a bit weeks ago I hadn't done any work with JS is an incredible transformation.
Finally, I am in constant limbo of frustration and self doubt vs getting excited about coding and feeling that BUZZ of creativity and building a craft.
This for me is a relief because I know that the frustrations over time will ease as my skills in this craft increase. Can we just skip to the part where Im a professional full stack web developer now?


 What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

 I really let myself down in feeling like an imposter for a long time. I suspect this wont end going into bootcamp either but this is something I want to work on. Its a terrible feeling that I want to shake off.
 Ideally I would have found myself a personal tech mentor because Ive seen how this relationship has helped others in my group (like a friend who just so happens to be a wizz at programming). Someone to openly and honestly checkin with daily and gauge where I am at technically. This just goes with surrounding yourself with others doing the same thing, immersion style. Which is why I am so excited for bootcamp. Im hoping that by surrounding myself with intelligent learners, I too will rise to their level.
 I could have persevered at the problems longer to figure a solution by myself but at times I just had no clue. My analytical and problem solving skills in logic and code are improving but I do know that this I exactly where I struggle. I did, however always make sure to understand the code and reverse pseudo code to myself.  
 But most importantly over the last 4 weeks of learning JS, I could have been a lot more kinder to myself. The first month of EDA was so exciting. The markup languages were relatively easy for me to pick up. But along came JS that mowed down my confidence and caused some pretty negative inner vibes. But like I said, I felt like I did really well to practice Mr Meng's mindfulness and remind myself that my emotions are not myself.

What did I do well this week?
This week I attacked the codecemy tasks with vigor and a lot of effort. My touch typing is improving drastically, which is even makes typing a real pleasure!

 What could I have done to improve?
 I feel as though I have burnt out a little this week and havn't completed the freecodeacademy course. I ran out of time and energy which is frustrating and entirely my fault. I could have invested more time into the sprint this week as my learning rate is very slow, slower than expected actually. I also needed to be on my best form for learning which was not helped with the past week being a big celebratory birthday week. I started the week slowly and from there it was hard to pick up pace.
 For this coming weeks sprint i'll not only need to complete freecodecourse but also jump right into it on Monday. Not Tuesday.

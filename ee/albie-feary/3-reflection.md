What did I do well this week?
This here is a double edged saw, as I'd say that attacking the sprint's content with vigor at the beginning of the week was great but I need to improve my momentum and keep that plodding mentality.

 What could I have done to improve?
 Now that Ive made my way through the content for the week I want to go back through and re-iterate all that we have covered so far to really cement the theory learnt so far.

What did I do well this week?
This week I did well to keep my calm focussed state when feeling out of my depth with the algorithms. I really enjoyed the pair programming exercise. It felt really good putting the humanity back into coding and to have that social aspect which I have been missing while remote studying.

What could I do well to improve?
I could improve my self confidence and be a better waver of my own flag.
I could always increase my typing speed.
I want to incorporate meditation into my daily schedule more.

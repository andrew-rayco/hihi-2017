What did I do well this week?
This week I remained calm while working through the challenges. I used different resources to supplement my learning. Importantly I have realised how far I have come in just 8 weeks and so feel very good indeed about this.


 What could I have done to improve?
 Persevere and stay hungry to solve the problem by myself. Be kind to myself and keep open minded of my abilities to pick up the knowledge fast.

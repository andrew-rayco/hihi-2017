Good job in completing the Javascript assignments this week. I got into the state of flow quite easily when tackling on these javascript challenges, I think I kind of enjoying looking for solutions for a problem. Also I am aware of how often my mind drifted away and I had to pull it back. I think I am getting better and better everyday, the mindfulness is helping me to stay focused. One thing I need to improve on is still not leaving some tasks until the end of week, I should aim for completing them 1-2 days earlier.

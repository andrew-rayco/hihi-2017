Why is reflection important?
I think it's important to learn from my mistakes, also if I reflect on what I did right, I could be happier as it's easy to forget on things and focus instead on failures.

What did I do well this week?
By completing all the assignments on time also learned heaps of new stuffs especially github, woohoo!

What could I have done to improve?
By making a habit to record time spent on work via Toggl, more self discipline to study without distractions.

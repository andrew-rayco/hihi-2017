#Reflection for Sprint 6
##What did I do well this week?
I got the minesweeper app working on the first day then completed all stretch day on Day Two. By completing my app early, I managed to spend time helping out my cohort members by debugging/solving their problems.

##What could I have done to improve?
Just realized a sprint's work is ending on Friday not Sunday. I will strive to complete all the assignment including the technical and cultural blogs by Friday.

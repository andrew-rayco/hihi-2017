# Reflection Week 9 
## What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0? 
* I kept up with the study despite working. I found it pretty tough but I made sure I managed my time well which helped me get through things.
* I made an effort to reach out to people. I can be quite shy and take a while to get to know people. I've been trying to make a real effort to push myself into just putting myself out there.
* I have gotten on top of CSS much bettter than I have managed to in the past. I've had some dealings with it previously and always gotten frustrated. I've made some pretty cool looking things though.
* I haven't gotten overwhelmed despite all the new stuff to learn.
* I have tried to work through problems myself rather than reverting to Stackoverflow.
* I have been diligently taking notes through the whole process.
* I have gotten better at using Chrome Dev Tools.
* I have approached everything with an open mind.
* My Mario Minesweeper was cool :)
* I had fun!

## What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0? 
* I could have spent more time coding. I did struggle to work full time and spend as much time as I would have liked coding. I would recommend to anyone else doing the course to try finishing up full time work at least a few weeks before the end of Phase 0.
* I was only able to attempt pair programming once over the 9 weeks. I would have liked to have given that more of a go.
* I treated some of the assignments like something I had to complete, rather than enjoying the journey. Towards the end, I started remembering the "Process over Product" mantra and that really helped.
* I am still a bit hazy about some of the algorithms work. I need to work harder at that.
* I need to work harder at remembering to meditate.
* I need to work better with some of the time managment techniques.

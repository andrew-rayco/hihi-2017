#Reflection

##Why is reflection important?
Reflection allows us to stop and have what we have been learning sink in. Turning over what we have learnt or done allows our brain to better process things and organise things while they are still fresh in the mind. It allows the good to be celebrated and the not so good to be thought about in order to improve on next time, thus hopefully allowing one to not repeat mistakes over and over again. I’m reminded of being told over and over again by teachers at school that cramming for an exam won’t help in the long term as you won’t really learn anything long term. Cramming allows you to solve a short term problem, not learn something permanently. Reflection allows someone to make the brain absorb things properly.

##What did I do well this week?
I made sure I worked through as many of the readings as I could. I organised my time well to ensure that I was able to juggle working full time and doing the lessons required of me. I made sure that I had a good environment to work in which allowed me to get through my lessons without too many distractions.

I have also tried to check into Slack as much as possible to begin to get to know my cohort. I have offered to help out anyone with any Linux issues as I've got some experience in that field and can hopefully help others out.

I enjoyed the CSS portion of the lessons this week and liked playing with web site I created to make it look how I wanted to.

I also tried to use Atom shortcuts where I could to make sure that I become more proficient with Atom. I am trying to make as many sink in as I can.

##What could I have done to improve?
I tended to get stuck disappearing down a rabbit hole at times until I’d read the time management technique resources. I still have to work on this to make sure that I am disciplined in the work that I do and don’t just spend hours fiddling around.

I am also going to start a journal next week to reflect on what I’ve done at the end of every study session I do. I will record useful things like snippets of code or snippets of code, as well as learning techniques I want to explore further, things that I have done well, things I haven’t done so well and things that I enjoy.

# Reflection Week 4 
## What did I do well this week?
* I felt like I did well in the exercises linking CSS, HTML and Javascript. I reall enjoyed some of the challenges like the counting the circles one. I felt that I had a good grasp of what was required.
* I felt like I was having fun again this week and I enjoyed the challenges more. I guess I like to feel like I'm building something. Last week felt like I was just answering questions.
* I am getting better with Atom.
* I have been trying mindful walking which I have found very useful

## What could I have done to improve?
* I need to work to make some my code more elegant. The chessboard exercise, which I enjoyed, was in fact a bit of a mess. There was a much easier way to solve it which I saw on Thomasina's git repo. I just couldn't quite see that at the time though.
* I need to take my time and read some of the instructions a little better.
* I need to work on meditating more.

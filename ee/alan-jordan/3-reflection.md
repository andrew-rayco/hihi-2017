# Reflection Week 3
## What did I do well this week?
* I did well at working through the resources this week rather than diving right
into the assignments.
* I also was much better this week at keeping notes in a small reflection journal
as I went through the resources and assignments. I have been tagging all of my
notes and have found this very useful when going back through them to find something
useful.
* I was finally able to pull myself out of my rabbit hole by realising that I had
spent enough time on what I was working on. However, this really did take more
time than it should have.
* I have been able to build a responsive site and I have implemented everything
in my wireframe that I wanted to.

## What could I have done to improve?
* I need to improve on my time boxing. I got very, very into trying to make my
site responsive which drove me to distraction. I need to be more aware of myself
when I am working and actually stop and take a break.
* I am not naturally great at design. I did struggle with making something look
interesting and this is something I would like to improve on.
* I haven't been as involved on Slack this week as I have had a busy week away from
study as well. I would like to improve on this so that I get to know my fellow cohort
members a little better.

# Reflection Week 7 
## What did I do well this week?
* I feel like I did quite well on the Algorithms problems even though I found them difficult.
* I have been getting better at meditation. Still not quite there but I am making more of an effort on it. 

## What could I have done to improve?
* I felt like I could have done better at the Pair Programming exercise. Was great pairing with Simon but I think possibly rushed this and could have spent more time on it. I've had a pretty hectic week away from EDA this week so that probably contributed.
* This week felt hard and I wish I could have spent more time on my coding. Life wasn't playing ball for me this week though. Really wish I had finished up work already. Not long now though.

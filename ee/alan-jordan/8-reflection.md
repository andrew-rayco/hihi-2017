# Reflection Week 8 
## What did I do well this week?
* Was really happy with my Calculator. When I went back to refactor it, there wasn't a huge amount more that I could so as I'd been trying to keep it as DRY as possible throughout the code. 
* Was better at adhering to the Process over Product mantra and not allowing myself to fall into a rabbit hole.

## What could I have done to improve?
* Meditation fell away this week. I really want to work on that over the coming week.
* Didn't manage to pair as my time was quite precious this week.

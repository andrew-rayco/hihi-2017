##What did I do well this week?
I was better with Toggl this week and made sure I tracked just about everything I did.
I have also been doing a small reflection exercise every time I finish any work. I have
been writing down things I enjoyed about the work, things I learnt and any useful notes
that I have about that work. I have also been trying to practice two minutes of mindfulness
each night.

##What could I have done to improve?
I have downloaded Headspace to my phone but I haven't yet used it. I could also possibly
space my work out a little better. I spent a lot of time on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
evenings and got through the bulk of the work. Breaking this up a little and spending more
time on the weekend may be better. I will try to do that next week.

# Reflection Week 6
## What did I do well this week?
* I felt like the code I wrote was a lot neater.
* I met some of my fellow Hihis on Friday which was awesome.
* I achieved all the stretch goals in the Minesweeper challenge.
* I was really happy with the styling of my Minesweeper board.

## What could I have done to improve?
* I really struggled on one particular loop which was being used to work out the win condition for the game. I needed to walk away. I knew it but I just kept on smashing my head against a brick wall.
* I still need to get better at reading the instructions.

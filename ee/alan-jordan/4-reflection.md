# Reflection Week 4 
## What did I do well this week?
* I slogged through some of the exercises even though I wasn't enjoying them. Reinforcing some of the Javascripts basics is important and I felt that this was worth the pain.
* Having studied some of this before, I didn't feel like I particularly struggled with anything, which I am happy with.
* I have continued with my reflection journal which I have been using to take notes as I go. It is proving very useful.
* I have been trying to help other members of my cohort where I can this week on Slack.

## What could I have done to improve?
* I have been trying to practice mindfulness where I can but I haven't always dedicated as much time as I would have liked. The readings this week will hopefully help me to begin to overcome this.

<h5> What did I do well this week? </h5>
  <p>
     This week I spent more time trying to understand the key concepts. I allocated time each day to study and assignments and I thought my overall time management was much better. I've also been more mindful which made me more relaxed and reflective.

<h5> What could I improve on? </h5>
  <p>
     The amount of time I'm dedicating to my course work could certainly increase. I don't think I'm putting aside enough time because I'm still not quite understanding Javascript. If I'm prompted to do something, whether it be a for loop or an if/else statement, I really do not understand how to do it. Hopefully in time this will change with more study...yikes.

  <h5> What did I do well this week? </h5>
    <p>
       This week I was able to spread my work throughout the week and felt much less pressure at the end of the week. I didn't manage to get everything completed by Sunday night, but that was only due to computer issues. I was more mindful this week and found working at the campus much better than working at home. The environment is great for learning and it is good to discuss difficulties with other people in my cohort. This week I also started to feel more comfortable with javascript and downloaded an app 'javascript anywhere' so I can practice anywhere.

  <h5> What could I improve on? </h5>
    <p>
      I can improve on my daily meditation, by increasing the regularity of it...I'm definately noticing improvement already, which is rewarding. I need to go into campus at least 3 times per week to increase my productivity and learn from my team mates. In the upcoming week I will spend more time on my website to make sure that it is surfable. I need a new menu bar and an overhaul to accomodate all of the blogs we will end up with.

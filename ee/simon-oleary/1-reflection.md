I see reflection as a very important part of learning so long as the individual approaches it in a positive frame of mind.
It is important to reflect on experiences and see what was done well and what can be improved. It provides a deeper awareness.
This week I did well to complete my assignments. I had some trouble with git and CSS, but I managed to problem solve online and by talking to other members in my cohort. Much of my problems came about by not having the correct software not spending enough time reading and learning the new skills.
In the upcoming week I will do more content reading before diving into assignments and dedicate consistent time to study and assignments. I have one more week of full time work, before I go part time for 4 weeks. I've enjoyed this week of learning, but I have found it stressful and difficult. I've read through the habits concepts today and I think I could certainly use some of them to improve my behaviour around study and learning.

I'm looking forward to challenges in sprint-2.

<h4> What did I do well this week? </h4>
   <p>
   It was a difficult week for me. I was struggling with motivation  and really did not apply myself as well as I had hoped I would. I found the Javascript basics difficult, but I enjoyed the challenge. In some respects the week before was more difficult trying to align the CSS. This week I much more mindful overall, I maintained a daily habit I had started in week 1. I ate healthy and my office work was really good in my business. I just did not apply myself to the standard I would expect.

<h4> What could I improve on from this week </h4>
   <p>
      Part of my issue lies in routine. I need to get up earlier and exercise so I can hit the ground running for the day. I exercised on 5 days last week, but none of the occasions were first thing in the morning. This week I will get up at 7 am each morning, meditate / practice mindfulness before going to work then practice mindfulness before studying. I'll report back :)

<h5> What did I do well over these first 9 weeks of phase 0? </h5>
  <p>
     I took on the challenge of learning a few new languages and improved my understanding from almost none to a semi intermediate beginner level. I'm autonomous in some aspects of each language and that has certainly added to my enjoyment. I was more mindful in general after reading through each chapter of 'search inside yourself' and I thought my overall attitude in some trying times was really good. I persevered when it felt like things were stacked against me. I managed to keep up while on the other side of the world.

<h5> What could I have done to improve? </h5>
  <p>
     I think dedicate more time to really reach my potential. If I managed to motivate myself to work harder I know that I would be at a higher level. It all starts with habit. I'm completely changing my life and this is a perfect opportunity for me to change some bad habits and build a great pathway. I believe it starts with exercise, meditation, fun and healthy eating. That's what I'm going to focus on for the next 9 weeks on a personal level.

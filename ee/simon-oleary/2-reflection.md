What did I do well this week?
This week I managed to spent 1-2 hours studying and working through assignments after 10-12 hour work days. I also realized pretty quickly each time If I felt like I would be productive and geared my study around this. I developed 2 new habits this. A few push ups after going to the bathroom and 2-5 minutes of mindfulness daily.
What could I do to improve?
I need to confirm my study technique and learn more about how I learn. I think that I'm a kinesthetic learner, but wonder whether I should be writing down all new content? I'll try this out and see if it helps me learn faster. I plan to start exercising in the mornings this week because I'm used to exercising for hours daily. I also plan to extend my daily meditation to 10 minutes.

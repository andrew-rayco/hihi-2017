<h5> What did I do well this week? </h5>
  <p>
     I managed to put aside time to work on my course work on most mornings and evenings, while visiting Germany and checking out the sites. I attempted to read and work while travelling in a car and plane...unsuccessfully. I got motion sickness. I practiced good morning habits with regular exercise and stretching before breakfast. Overall my mindfullness and control over my mind is improving.

<h5> What could I improve on? </h5>
  <p>
     Allocating more time to work. My most productive time while on holiday is in the mornings. I've only been able to do an hour to 90 minutes of work per morning in the last week. If I get up at 7 am and exercise, then work from 8-10 am I can acheive more each day. I will make that my mission for the upcoming week. I will also plan to read 2 chapters of Eloquent Javascript. I'm not feeling very comfortable with my understanding of the language at this stage in the course and would much rather in a situation where I feel that I'm on par with the rest of my cohort. At the moment I'm certainly behind.

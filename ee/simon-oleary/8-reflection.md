What did I do well this week?

This week I worked hard on the calculator. I read 2 chapters of 'eloquent javascript' and one chapter of 'search inside yourself'. The time of day and amount of time I was working was sporadic due to travelling commitments. I still managed to dedicate many hours and any free time was spent on the computer, which I must say was not very enjoyable.

What could I improve on?

I could have done more preparation for work each day to get myself in the right frame of mind. Many times when I sat down to work I was quickly distracted by something else. If I do some mindfulness before I start my computer work, this will help me find the right zone. I still think I am not dedicating enough time, I'm not understanding javascript very well at all yet and it quite a worry. More study this week coming week.

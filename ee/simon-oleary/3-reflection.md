<h4> What did I do well this week? </h4>
<p> This week I persevered when the going got tough. I had big trouble trying to style my site and ultimately spent far too much time on it. I managed to go back to basics and get it complete. I learnt so much about HTML and CSS this week. It was fun and frustrating at the same time trying to work out how to do certain features of the website. I went into campus twice this week. I plan to go in 3 times next week. I exercised twice this week and meditated 3 times total for 2-3 minutes each time. I can do better. </p>

<h4> What could I improve on for next week? </h4>
<p> I need to stop comparing my work to others in the cohort. I'm very competitive and finding it difficult seeing all the great work that is coming from my cohort...they are doing great and I'm happy for them, but I really want to match them. I need to let my ego settle. I'm happy with my progress so far and I'm really just remembering or learning how to learn again. My goals for this week are to exercise every morning, meditate twice per day and complete the course work by Saturday afternoon. </p>

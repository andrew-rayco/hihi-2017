What did I do well this week?

This week I was really good about focusing on process over product. By the end of the week I had a soild understanding of how my minesweeper program worked. Slowly but surely I'm connecting the dots with JavaScript.


 What could I have done to improve?

 I think I should try to go out of my comfort zone more. Once I have a working program I'm too scared to change it, because I don't want to break the work I've already produced.

<p>What did I do well this week?</p>

<p> JavaScript was unfarmiliar teritory for me. So this week I gained a better understanding of the languge itself and how it is used. </p>

<p> What could I have done to improve? </p>

<p> I need to get better at taking more regular breaks, I find I am much more effective at problem solving after taking a break. </p>

What did I do well this week?
This week I managed to improve my problem solving skills and gain more confidence using html and css.
In particular I focused on divs this week. Though it took me awhile to work out, I now understand how to use them.

What could I have done to improve?
I think I need to spend more time on github, familarising myself with where to find the course materials. I'm also a little scared of making branches.
I'm paranoid I'm going to delete someone elses work. Hopefully I'll gain more confidence going forward.

What did I do well this week?
I think I followed the practice of process over product quite well. There were times when I wanted to add all this extra code to my website that I didn't really understand. The code made my website look alot better, but I decided to focus on the process. There was no put including it, if I didn't understand it yet.

What could I have done to improve?
I need to remind myself to stay calm when things don't work. I easily panic, and this is a waste of energy because nine times out of ten it's often just a tiny error that needs correcting.

 Reflection is a really important aspect of learning a new skill.
Through reflection, I'm able to summarise how far I have come in a week.
This week I became more comfortable using commandline and learning html code.
Going forward, I need to be less anxious when I run into a obstacle, and instead, problem solve calmly.

What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

I feel like I've really enjoyed the challenge of learning something completely new.
I'm excited to continue this learning in bootcamp.

 What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

 I need to be less harsh with myself, I hold myself to a really high standard.
 I need to remember that its ok to make mistakes when you're learning.

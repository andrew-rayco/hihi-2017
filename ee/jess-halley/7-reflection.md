What did I do well this week?

Instead of focusing on making things visually appealing, I really focused on understanding every element of my JavaScript code. This is technique is helping me gain more confidence in JavaScript



What could I have done to improve?

I need to stop comparing my code, to the amazing work I see on github and stack over flow.

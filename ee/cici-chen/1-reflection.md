Why is reflection important?
  It's part of the learning process, so that you're more conscious to improve.
What did I do well this week?
  I'm really comfortable with command line now and got an ok hang of the basic
  work flow of Github... Finally after much much struggle. Still wanna get a
  better understanding of this system though.
What could I have done to improve?
  1)Time management. Seriously I have to keep up with the deadline.
  2)I should have asked for help sooner.And not waste time on things I didn't get
  at first.

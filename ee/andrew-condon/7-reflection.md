# Reflection sprint seven

## What did I do well this week?
I enjoyed the pair programming and felt that Sarah and I worked well together.
I've tried the FreeCodeCamp algorithms before and had much more success this
time around. Obviously the experience helped, but it's a more solid
understanding of the fundamentals. A better grasp of how the different data
types can interact. Things went how I expected mostly. Mostly. So there was some
satisfaction to take away from that.

## What could I have done to improve?
I didn't complete everything by Sunday, which isn't the first time. Not that
the workload was too much, just poor time management from me.

I could've spent more of my spare time working on those intermediate algorithms.
That Seek and Destroy challenge was a solid block for me for I'd say about half
of the entire four hour timebox.

My meditation this week was absolutely terrible. I've missed a few days in a
row. So weird when I'm really starting to appreciate the benefits. Now that I'm
doing the 20 minute headspace exercises, it seems harder to find the will to
do it. I'll have to pick it back up again.

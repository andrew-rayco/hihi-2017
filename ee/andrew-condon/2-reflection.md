#Reflection sprint two

##What did I do well this week?
I read like a banshee. I had reading up the wazoo. I read every word in every article in every concept. 
Some of it was easier reading than others. There were times when I was struggling, and I felt a bit of pressure to skip over things when I saw my fellow Hihi already posting blog entries. Yet still I read. 

Once the reading was over and work responsibilities for the week taken care of, I'm pretty pleased with how I powered through the tasks. There was some confusion about the Udacity course (what constituted lessons 1 and 2). It turns out I may have done both in one go. So it was nice to discover that it was done when the task came up. 

I'm also pretty pleased with my Toggling this week. I was much more consistent with starting and stopping the timer. I'm thankful for their pomodoro option for that - it does the stopping for me. 

Speaking of Pomodoro, I did that well this week too. I took my breaks like a good boy and it's worth it if for no other reason than I can do some back/leg stretches to help stave off back pain from sitting in the chair for long periods of time. 

##What could I have done to improve?
I struggle to read long articles on a screen. I pondered printing them out, but the sheer wastefulness turned me off that. My attention span seems to be considerably less reading things on my machine compared to a book. I suppose the only thing that's going to change that is more screen-reading. I use reading tools that eliminate a lot of the article fluffery and optimises the content for better reading. That helps. In short, I could've read faster.

I read all the tasks ahead, but I didn't fully comprehend them. The act of doing so actually made me feel a shade overwhelmed, so I mainly just skimmed them. This left me feeling on more than a few occasions as though I didn't know how much there was left to do. I'll be sure to give myself more time to do so next sprint.

# Reflection sprint nine

## What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?
I enjoyed myself. I didn't take any shortcuts. I reached out to help others when
I thought I might've been able to (not always successfully, but that's okay). I
recognised when I needed some time away and took the time when needed.
On the whole I've been very honest with myself and have taken the tougher path
when I had the choice.

## What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?
There were times when my time management wasn't ideal. I felt I could've been
at EDA HQ more often, particularly with the calculator task. I don't know if
I didn't go that often because I was being lazy or shy. I didn't keep up with
the journaling and reflection notes, and I've let my meditation lapse somewhat.

I feel I really could've spent more time on some of my own 'stretch' tasks on
those slower/easier sprints. At times I took it too easy once I had ticked the
boxes. Not all the time, but it happened. I told myself that it was good to
rest, and maybe that's true to some extent, but still on those weeks I gave
myself a four out of five for effort in the Weekly Feedback Form.

#Reflection sprint 1

##Why is reflection important?
Reflection helps the brain move new knowledge from the short term memory into the long term memory. It's also effective as a source of assessment of one's progress, be it self-assessment or otherwise.

##What did I do well this week?
I started out the week well. Real nice like. I was powering along until it became clear that I was missing some waffles and wasn't powering on as swiftly as I thought.

I'm pretty happy with my little website too. I could tweak that puppy for days. I never feel like I'm finished with a website. There's always something I want to nudge, but I'm happy with it anyhoo.

I stuck with the pomodoro timer well. I'm really pleased with that technique.

##What could I have done to improve?
I'm terrible at remembering to start and stop my Toggl. An employers worst nightmare. I'll work on that. I'm moving my pomodoro timing from my phone to Toggl, that should help.

It would have been wiser to NOT try installing a dual-boot of Ubuntu onto my Windows machine. That pretty well consumed about two days of allocated EDA time. This time lost, coupled with the very real thought that I had idiotically broken my Windows, heightened my stress levels somewhat. I have Windows back, but still no Ubuntu. Many thanks on that score to those that helped. Particularly Alan and Bev. I haven't given up, I'm just a hell of a lot more cautious now. The more difficult it is, the more I want it.

To improve, it would've been a good idea to start that tiny meditation habit during the periods of higher anxiety. I didn't though. I'll try and learn from that.

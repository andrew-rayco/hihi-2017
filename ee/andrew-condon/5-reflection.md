# Reflection sprint five

## What did I do well this week?
I dedicated this week to my focus or meta-attention, and I gotta say I'm pretty
pleased with how I did. This is one of the greatest benefits I find from the
meditation, and it's really been a revelation to me that it's something that one
can purposefully train. With hindsight it really seems obvious, doesn't it?

With this increased focus on my focus, I was super productive. I obviously feel
that this was a bit of a light week with the amount of material, but still I
felt very much in the flow for most of the exercises.

I'm loving the terminal. Now that I've finally managed to dual-boot Ubuntu on my
Windows machine, I can enjoy it without feeling like I'm using a cheap knockoff.
This weekend I plan to replace my laptop HDD with an SSD to improve performance
of my machine, and there's a bit of anxiety that it'll mess up my rather fickle
and confusing setup. Fingers crossed it goes smoothly.

Getting used to Ubuntu has meant installing software in the command line. What
a joy this is. It just seems so much simpler than googling the product, visiting
their site, downloading their package and installing it. I just type apt-get
whatever and here it comes. Brilliant.

## What could I have done to improve
I could've improved my time management skills by not assuming that the repeat
tasks of each sprint (the technical and 'spiritual' blog along with this
reflection) was a relatively small task. I need to ensure I allocate more time
to it next sprint.

I would've been happier if I solved the chess board puzzle without having to use
the hints. I was quite hard on myself which isn't unfair. I could've and
should've been kinder to myself.

Also, I made a note from last week to spend some time getting more familiar with
some concepts like css centering and absolute & relative positioning. I didn't
do it. I need to be careful to not consider the bootcamp tasks my 'work', and
then leave it at that. I should be continuing to use my spare time to iron out
my skills wherever I can. Part of me is fearful that come the end of bootcamp
I'll be sick of code and lose my desire to pursue a career in it, and that I
should enjoy my free time when I have it. I'm not sure that way of thinking is
conducive to optimising my learning.

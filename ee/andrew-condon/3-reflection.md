#Reflection sprint three

##What did I do well this week?
Time management, for starters, was one of the best things about this week. 
True, I believe there's a generally smaller workload this sprint, but I'm 
happy for that because I've felt a little behind getting through the tasks 
in the past couple of weeks. Even though that was likely work related, I 
still felt a bit of pressure.

Meditation. I had a really good week of meditation. I felt like I made some
progress controlling attention, and even felt the benefits of that when I'd 
do some reading after the meditation session. I felt clearer and my focus 
was less inclined to slip away.

I'm really proud of the update to the blog site this week. It's also kinda
something that I could've improved on this week as well, because I gave too
much focus to the product over the process. I'll be sure to work on that.

Fun. I really had some fun this week. I believe feeling less pressure was 
a big part of that. It's also 

##What could I have done to improve?
As mentioned above, I couldn't stop tweaking the site when the six hour 
timebox limit had come and gone. Contrary to, I believe, the overriding goal
of this exercise. 

Additionally, I'm going to really work on committing more regularly with 
smaller commits. I tend to only do it rarely because it's not really much 
of a reflex yet. I'll get there. I'm sure it'll really sink in when I one 
day need to revert to a previous commit to recover a mess-up I just know is 
coming.

##Some things I'm going to devote some time to in the next week or two. 
These are areas where I feel a lack a fundamental understanding. I tend to 
just punch in a CSS property because it feels like it should be the right 
one. I'd ideally prefer to know which property is required based on an 
understanding of how they work.

I've heard a lot about Grid, so I'm gonna take that for a Hello World too. 

Centering with CSS, 
Absolute and relative positioning, 
Flexbox, and 
Grid.

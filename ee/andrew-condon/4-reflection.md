#Reflection sprint four

##What did I do well this week?
Everything started out great with my time commitment and progress. I really
felt like I was powering along. I was quite happy with my focus levels, and
particularly pleased at how well I remembered what I had learned the first
times I went through Codeacademy and FreeCodeCamp.

More than anything, I was overjoyed to learn that the concepts (particularly
classes, and prototypal inheritance) that I struggled with the first times
through were much easier to understand this time. Whether that was due to the
time spent between last time and now, or more to do with the reading and
experimentation I had done in between I can't be sure. It may have even been
because I'm getting better at not blocking off my mind when I think things are
difficult. Hopefully that's here to stay.

##What could I have done to improve?
Okay, so I totally did the wrong Codeacademy JavaScript course. I did the
'learn JavaScript' (I think that's what it was called) instead of the
'JavaScript' course. Easy to get them confused eh?
That was a pretty big dampener on the progress I was feeling, but I choose to
look at it as extra reinforcement of the knowledge. Better to go over the
fundamentals a few times to lock them in.

I really need to implement some sort of meditation schedule. There have been
a couple of days this week where I missed/forgot to meditate. This disappoints
me. I'm very much enjoying meditation and can see the benefits of it, so I'd
really like to stick to my commitment to meditate daily. At the moment I'm just
meditating when a small window appears in my day. I need to start doing it
first thing every morning.

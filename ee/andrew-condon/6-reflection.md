# Reflection sprint six

## What did I do well this week?
This week I put process over product and I'm super proud of myself for that.
Instead of faffing about making the thing look pretty, I tried things in
JavaScript. Some things didn't work out. Some things were much tougher than I
anticipated, but I tried things and really enjoyed it (most of the time).

I've been more successful at making meditation a part of my daily routine this
week.

## What could I have done to improve?
I started out the week super swiftly. I had the minesweeper working on Monday,
so I thought I'd enjoy my first week off work and take it easy for a few days.
Now here I am on Friday playing catch up.

I keep writing off the technical and cultural blog as much smaller tasks than
they actually are. Every week. And every week I'm surprised at how long I spend
doing them. Next week I'm going to remember that I need to allow more time for
those suckers.

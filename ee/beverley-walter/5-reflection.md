What did I do well this week?
Perseverance! The days where I wanted to hide in bed and not get up - not face working. When I wanted to refuse to ever attempt JavaScript again... I didn't run away. I took a break and came back and tried again. I kept doing it. Reinforcing what I had done. Going over it again. Writing notes. In my own words. I made notes. GOOD NOTES. I talked too, to the other Hi-hi's we supported each other and bonded in our shared frustrations. That felt really good.

What could I have done to improve?
I feel like I am saying this every week, but I need to be nicer to myself. Gentler. Talk to myself as though I am my best mate. Not listen to the horrible little voice in my head that wants to pull me down. I can hear myself talking to others about their experiences, telling them how well they are doing, and to stick with it. But my voice tells me I am crap, useless and failing. It's a very strange sensation. I'd like to stop this from happening.

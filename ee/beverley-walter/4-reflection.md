What did I do well this week?
Nothing?! Persevered? I didn't give up (well, I haven't yet). Maybe I maybe a mistake in trying to stick with the Codecademy stuff for too long. I just wanted to be able to say I had attempted and completed everything. I think maybe I exhausted my brain on the buggy program. So by the time I came to look at CodeCamp - which seems much better. I just couldn't face it. At this point I have about 30 of their challenges left to go, and I am tired and grumpy with the whole thing.
I did download a few additional resources and apps to play around in which seem to have smaller chunks of learning. Progressing through those faster, made me feel better. 

 What could I have done to improve?
 Perhaps give up? I don't know, I asked for help, I used the chat rooms. I used the internet. I wasn't on campus much so wasn't able to chat with other hihi's. I don't really feel like I am 'blocked' so to speak. I am still moving forward, just really, really slowly. I feel good about getting there on my own. I just feel frustrated by the slow pace. Hoping it means its sinking in. Perhaps a bit of a low point for me... so anything will be an improvement. :p

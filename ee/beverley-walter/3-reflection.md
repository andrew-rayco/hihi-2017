What did I do well this week?
Designy stuff. That's certainly my happy place. I also was pleased with my recall on some parts of the command line and code tags etc. :)

What could I have done to improve?
I keep getting my toggle in a twist. I forget to turn it off, then I get a message telling me I have been working for 54 hours.... I have kept timesheets all my career. So I know how to time my tasks. I am just getting in a muddle with toggle. Also I have got myself a litle over tired. I think I need to make sure I get a little more sleep.

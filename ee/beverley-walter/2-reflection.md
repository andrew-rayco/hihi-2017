What did I do well this week?
No tears! No crying. Pleased about that. I also made it into school (met a few other hihi's) and worked through chunks of the tasks with clear focus. The command line is making more sense, the waffle-board scares me less. I felt good about adding pages to my blog too, it all just seemed to flow a bit better. :)


What could I have done better?
I want to spent a little more time figuring out git hub. I seem to get flustered every time I come to deal with it. Bit more time reading. Also going to do yoga, and try and finish stuff earlier in the week.

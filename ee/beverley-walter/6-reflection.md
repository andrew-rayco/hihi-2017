What did I do well this week?
I took better breaks. I am really worried that this means I am going to be really behind next week, but I din't think I had too much choice as my computer broke. I redirected my energy into things I could do in the mean time and it felt good to get a little bit of head space from code. Hoping I will be refreshed next week, after being a bit more gentle with myself.
What could I have done to improve?
I'd like to have done a bit more reading and completed the stretch goals. However its difficult to code without a computer. So now that this issue is fixed I should be ready to rock. :)

Why is reflection important?
For me, this week, the reflection stage has helped me realise how much I have taken in. I really didn't feel like I was getting anywhere by mid week. But tonight I have done all the command prompts off the top of my head.

 What did I do well this week?
 Yay me! I celebrated little wins. (Thanks Mr Fogg). I found a bit of time to meditate too. "I'm awesome!"

 What could I have done to improve
 Not. Panic. :)

What did I do well this week?
I think I tackled the algorithms well - I didn't complete many, and intend to go back and complete a few more. I tried not to allow myself to get bogged down into it too much and instead, challenged myself to find answers/solutions rather than trying to conjure them out of my own head. I think I need to spend a little more time typing out the sequence instead of going around in circles looking at wrong answers.

 What could I have done to improve?
 I need to improve my sleeping patterns. I have allowed myself to get tired, and with sickness in my house atm that is not a smart move. Once better rested I think the level of effort I can bring will be imporved as a result.

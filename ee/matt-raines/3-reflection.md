What did I do well this week?
I feel I didn't do well on many things at all this week. My time wasn't managed
well around my trip and I lost a lot of motivation to work when I became sick and
therefore got behind on the work load.

What could have I done to improve?
I could have planned out time to work around my trip before I left and when I was
sick I could have made more of an effort to do the work.

Although an experience alone is a great way to learn, reflecting on that experience has shown to be extremely productive and a great way to learn even more from the said experience. It is important that we reflect on this to help us grow not only from our successes but our mistakes as well. This week I felt i did well to figure many of my struggles out my own way rather than just asking for someones help straight away. I also felt i did well not to come into many issues along the way by understanding what i was doing first before i dove head first into it. I could have improved on a few things this week. Those being: Managing my time better rather than having to work throughout my weekend to finish the assignment, as well as working away from distractions rather than trying to work through/around my flat mates who don't have to study yet.

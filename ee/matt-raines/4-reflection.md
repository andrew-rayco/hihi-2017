What did I do well this week?
Once again don't have all that much to be stoked about at the end of the week as
it has been a mix of catching up and tough learning but im glad to be at the end
of it now and im keen to get amongst this new work.
What could I have done to improve?
Definitely could have managed my time a lot better this week so I am looking
forward to getting back to wellington and finding a good work schedule to work
around.

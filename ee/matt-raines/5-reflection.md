What did I do well this week?
I feel that although I struggled with the difficulty of the content from sprint-5,
I handled it well amongst the chaos of traveling around.
What could I have done to improve?
Once again time management seems to be something I really need to focus on improving,
hence my aim for sprint-6 is to finish it before sunday.

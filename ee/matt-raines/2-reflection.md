I made sure I had all the work I needed to do complete before the weekend which
I was happy with. I timed everything well on Toggl this week as well which is
hopefully the start of a good habit.
To improve I think I could have done more work earlier in the week still. Even
though I did complete the work I wanted to before the weekend I still feel I
could be more proactive to achieve work at the start of each week just incase
I get stuck on something that takes longer than expected I know I will have
plenty of time left to finish it off. I also feel that I need to form better
habits when it comes to the amount of time I attend at EDA because there is no
doubt I get so much more work done down there it is just the initial trip and
organization to get to the office that I need to form better habits around.

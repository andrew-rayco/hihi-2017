What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?
I felt that I kept a positive attitude throughout the first 9 weeks of the course
regardless of how tough and stressful things got for me. I also feel I that I did well
getting to know the majority of our cohort before we head into the bootcamp.

What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?
Definitely could have done a lot to have made my life easier over the first nine weeks.
My time management as a whole was dog shit and I really struggled to self teach and self
motivate myself with my flat mates being at home with no work to do.

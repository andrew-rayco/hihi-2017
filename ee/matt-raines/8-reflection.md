What did I do well this week?
I got the main chunk of the sprint out of the way with Kelly and Zac which went really well.

What could I have done to improve?
I lost a lot of motivation when we finished the calculator and got behind due to the easter break.
Could have focused earlier in the week to complete everything and then I could have relaxed with
my flatmates over the weekend.

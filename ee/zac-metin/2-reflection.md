What I did well this week:

Coming into course every day definitely helped a lot as I found it way easier to focus here than at home with too many distractions. It also meant that I could get help from other Hihi students whenever I got stuck, as well as learning some interesting things such as adding features to Atom, specific bits of code/tricks etc.

What I can do better:

I still didn't come into course early in the morning, was generally making it in at about 10-11am and I still need to do more work to fix my sleeping patterns.

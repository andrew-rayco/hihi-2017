This week what I did well was getting into EDA every day, and as a result I have all the tasks done by Thursday. Maybe this week was easier than usual though, I don't know. I still need to work on going to bed earlier and waking up earlier as its actually not that long until the bootcamp and it would be nice to have normalized sleeping patterns a bit before then. I also think one thing I did well this week was asking for help when I needed it, which for the dots exercise was quite often.

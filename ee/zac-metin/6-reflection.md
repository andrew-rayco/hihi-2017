This week what I did well was using debugger to find problems in my code, however this didn't work all the time because my code was sometimes wrong but still functional, so nothing was coming up in debugger.

What I could improve was focus, I had some interesting film projects on and found my mind drifting to those during some of the more boring or difficult parts of the minesweeper project.

Honestly it doesn't feel like I did a lot well this week, but I also didn't do anything poorly.

It was just a super average week, not in a bad way, but where I just got stuff done, wasn't overly interested but also was not bored. It is foundational and has to be done, and I know it will lead to some cooler stuff so its motivation to just get through it.

I guess that's real short but not a lot more to say.

Reflection is important because it is basically the mind's version of digestion with the initial processing of information being the 'eating' component. In reflecting, you take on board the information at a much higher rate because it has shown a second instance of relevance, and it is being gone back over with the initial comprehension already taken care of.

What I did well this week was making an effort to further explore the questions that came up during my study, this helped me cement what I had already learned by exploring it in a context that interested me enough to actually seek it out outside of the preassigned tasks.

I can improve by spending more time at EDA. It is such a good environment to work on and I found I was much more focused doing work there than when I was at home. So in coming weeks I will make an effort to spend more time there.

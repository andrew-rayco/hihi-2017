What did I do well this week?
This week I did much better at time management. Spread my work more over the course of the week. That went well. Felt much better about how I was handling it while I was doing it too (ie. felt less stressed). I also managed to get more of a grasp on git commands and branching and such (with only a few errors/restarts during the actual assignment) cause I spent a bit of extra time on that earlier in the week. Feeling more comfortable with that whole area.


What could I have done to improve?
This week I wanted to go in and meet some of the cohort on campus. I didn't manage to do that. I also ended up being busy on Friday when the reviews happened. So next week I'm going to make more of an effort to interact with the others (starting by making it in to campus!). I had individual chats with a few people, but I'd like to engage with the larger cohort more.

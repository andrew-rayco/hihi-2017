Why is reflection important?
It allows us to take a look back and see how we're going. To see what worked, what didn't, and what we might need help with. To be able to do this yourself is an invaluable skill. We hardly ever have someone who can look over and see this for us. Especially not better than we can look at ourselves.

What did I do well this week?
To be honest, handling being suddenly doing a course I wasn't expecting to be doing a week or two ago. I got all the pre-prep stuff on Monday, and while that freaked me out a little, and that I couldn't access the waffle page I thought I should (it wasn't up yet), I was still able to sort through it.

What could I have done to improve?
Time (and self) management. The last few parts of the assignment got pushed back a number of times. The first few I had scheduled and accomplished within time. But then the weekend happened. Unexpected plans came up, and because I didn't have time specifically designated for doing the more wordy things (that I'm not so good at), they got pushed much further than they should have.

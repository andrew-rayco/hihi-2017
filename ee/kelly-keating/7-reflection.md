What did I do well this week?
This week I really did well at being proactive with the tasks. I had commitments the latter half of the week that started earlier than expected, but because I had made sure to start the exercises as early as I possibly could I was actually essentially finished before Wednesday rolled around!

What could I have done to improve?
The very first task of that sprint involved working in a pair. While it was okay to not have worked with another I would've liked to have done so. I did this task late at night, not the best time to find a willing collaborator, and perhaps if I had done this at the very beginning of the week I would have been able to partner up with someone before I started powering through the tasks myself.

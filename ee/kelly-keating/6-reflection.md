What did I do well this week?
I progressed quite nicely through the challenges this week. Times when I couldn't get things working, sometimes for no apparent reason, I did things like taking a bit of a break so I didn't get too frustrated. It meant things were more nicely spaced out over the course of the week too. After recent times where I've been unavailable for part of the week, actually getting to move at a normal pace through the tasks meant I got to do a bit more exploring (though not as much as I wanted to with some of the stretch goals)

What could I have done to improve?
Not held onto tasks where I wanted to finish all the bits perfectly (such as the stretch goals for the minesweeper). I should just've submitted it with some of those remaining unfinished rather than not because I want to finish everything absolutely, including some things that were unnecessary.

What did I do well this week?
This week I enjoyed what I was doing, and found it easy enough to pull together various things we learnt in previous weeks. Which is reassuring that it has sunk in some.

What could I have done to improve?
As I was not here at the beginning of the week I found it difficult to get into the swing of things as my usual tactics were thrown out. Being able to work with this inconvenience and not let it affect how I worked so much would be great. Making a new schedule to stick to perhaps.

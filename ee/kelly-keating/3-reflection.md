What did I do well this week?
This week I did get into the campus, and also made the check in before we had some technical issues. I enjoyed going through the mobile design resources at the beginning at the week, but let my own issues distract me during the middle. It then meant I wasn't able to do as much playing around with the code during the weekend as I wanted. I felt really good doing the mindfulness exercises this week.

What could I have done to improve?
As I mentioned, my overall time management wasn't great, but my task management during allotted times is really going well.

Reflection is important because if you get your reflection right, next time you will be more efficient with your tasks and learning.

What did I do well this week?

This week I feel like I asked questions from the cohort and got an immediate answer. I could have troubleshooted myself but I think I saved at least 30 mins by asking the question.

What could I have done to improve?

I should have spent one hour a day practicing touch typing which is not coming easily to me. But i did not invest that time.

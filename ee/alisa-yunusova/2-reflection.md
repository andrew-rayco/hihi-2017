What did I do well this week?

Made progress with touch typing and tried to touch type not only when doing coding assignments but also when writing emails and going about day to day typing tasks that come up.

What could I have done to improve?

I made a mistake of binge watching Udemy videos on Monday then got very busy throughout the week then started doing assignments in the end of the week and got stressed because I didn't remember things so I had to rewatch some videos which pretty much doubled the amount of work I had to do. What I should have done instead is to make my video watching more bite-sized and attempt to implement new concepts right there and then in my own blog not just following udemy's practice instructions

What did I do well this week?
I did timeboxing well, in terms to keeping to allocated time. I did not get as far as I hoped design wise. My website doesn't look very pretty and looks like blocks. Also I hit some sort of plato with touch typing and my speed is not improving and I make a lot of mistypes still, which is very costly to speed.
What could I have done to improve?
Possibly browse the internet more for website ideas. All the ones I collected from zen garden I ended up finding too heavy and hard and more so some of them were not even responsive. I guess I am still searching for a design philosophy. Using framework such as skeleton took care of a lot of things and messiness, but I perhaps need more appreciation for best practice when making design choices.

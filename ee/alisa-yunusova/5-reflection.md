What did I do well this week?
I got through all exercises this week and followed along well I feel.
What could I have done to improve?
I was on holidays in Australia this week spending time with family so that got in the way of going over all the js exercises moer than 1 time. even though everything made sense i'd like to go over the exercises again.

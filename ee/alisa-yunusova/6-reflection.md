What did I do well this week?
I managed my time well, in a sense that I started early and gave myself an opportunity to give up and re-attempt more clear headed.
What could I have done to improve?
I sense something is not quite right about my touch typing learning strategy as I still make a lot of mistakes. I think I will dedicate more time to practicing next week

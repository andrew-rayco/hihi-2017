What did I do well this week?
Finishing freeCodeCamp was really good it really reinforced the basic knowledge.
Especially after playing around a bit with it now it makes a lot more sense how it will be applied later on.

 What could I have done to improve?
 I could have have used some of the new skills I learned in a more real life application to test them out but I have run out of time.
 I could also improve my time management skills.

 Why is reflection important?
 Reflection is improtant because in enables ones self to review what they are doing well and not so well and improve so you don't continue to make the same mistake over and over or at least minimize it if you can't completly illiminate it.

 What did I do well this week?
 I really stuck with timeboxing and didn't get stuck on anything for too long which helped me stay a lot more focused.

 What could I have done to improve?
I could have a done some of the free code camp things to stick with the javascript or play around a bit more with it this week in my free time so I don't forget it.

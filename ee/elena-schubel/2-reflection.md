What did I do well this week?
I did a little bit more research and played around more with another project with javascript to get a better understanding so hopefully next week I can have that in as well.

What could I have done to improve?
Cleaner code I will improve on that next week and leave comments so I know at a quick glance what something is in CSS or in HTML.

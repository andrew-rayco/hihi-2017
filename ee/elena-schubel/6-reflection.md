What did I do well this week?
I got a lot despite getting nothing done last week as I was in the bush and mountains last week. This week has been pretty tricky geting any work with limited internet connection and triky terrain. 

What could I have done better?
I think I have handled things pretty well all things considering. As plans kept having to be changed do to weather.

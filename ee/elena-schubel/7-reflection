What did I do well this week?
I have stayed calm and kept pushing to get my study done while there has been a continuous amount of choas around.  

What could have I done better? 
I think over all I have done pretty well. Maybe a better diet I have lost a bit of weight being in the bush and mountains. Also I might have to find my glasses again looking at a screen for longer periods of times seems to bring on a headache and pretty bad eyestrain.

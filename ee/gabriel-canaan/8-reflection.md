 Hey there Hihi's 
 Just a short and sweet one this week I'm afraid.I have had unplanned business this weekend when I had planned to casually finish up all the homework.
 I worked through the calc challenge early on in the week in at school as a small group and then decided to start a brand new version and have finished up with an unholy jumble that has none of the good bits and all the mess.
 A good lession learnt I suppose.

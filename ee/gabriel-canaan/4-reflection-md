 I was pleased this wek with the way I reached out on slack with the hickups I had with the Two courses. That was something I wanted to work on from the previous sprints.

 I could have improved a lot with regards to managing my time. I didn't work well with codecademy so I should have used alternitive resources to help me. I could have taken more time on understanding what the tasks actually required as they were often less complicated than I made them

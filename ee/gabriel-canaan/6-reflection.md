I was happy with the way the sprint began and I got off to a good start. I had a lot of communication with a few Hihi’s and hopefully helped out a bit as well as receiving some great tips as well. I read a lot and am more comfortable than last week.<br>

Contrary to the above, I’m still not happy with my position at the moment and will need a big push this sprint to get up to the level of proficiency I expect from myself. That might sound a bit dark but  in fact it’s probably the exact opposite. I’m really enjoying learning and stretching myself, It’s been too long since I tried something that I’m not good at and complacency is not something I wish to creep into my life.

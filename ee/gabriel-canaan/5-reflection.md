Well well. Where to start ?
What have I done well this week ? ......   Bloody good question.
Not to much to report to be honest. Not going mental, quite happy with that. Sticking at it when I felt I was in over my head … hmmm, yip.
 Not being afraid to take a few steps backwards to review last sprint’s tutorials to get a better handle on this weeks work I think helped me a lot, even if it meant my waffle board looked unimpressive.
 Trying to look for positives, I did find myself hooning through assignments 5.2 to 5.4 (with a little help from sheryls magic wand, niiice!) and the blogs of course. As for the rest  tbc.


What I didn’t do so well on … let me count the ways.
I’m still not at all confident with the JS basics. I’m well over thinking that I will some kind of code prodigy, but I am disappointed with myself at the speed (or lack thereof) with which I am picking it up. It’s not the end of the world and it’s only Friday afternoon and I have finished the bulk of the sprint. I have also,the whole weekend to devote to swoting hard out.
Telly ho.

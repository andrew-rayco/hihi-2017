I mm happy with the effort that I have put in throughout Phase 0 if not with the level that I find myself at.
I started off a bit slowly with regards to the interaction with the cohort, not through any reluctance but more because I thought my learning style lent towards solo study. I am glad to say that I recognized pretty quickly that collaboration and communication were also important and have been amongst the aspects I have most enjoyed.
Typing continues to be a problem, I think itâ€™s just the way my brain is wired. I practice quite a bit but remain painfully slow.
A bit more time on JS I suppose could have been spent as it is still rather perplexing, there were other things to do however, eating, sleeping etc.
So, excited, nervous in a good way and now just looking forward to getting on with it.
See you in the morning.

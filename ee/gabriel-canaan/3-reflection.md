I am quite pleased with the way I managed to achieve a responsive site. I tried loads of different approaches and although I obviously relied on uncle Google heavily; I also tinkered around just using the few skills, techniques and tips I have picked up over the last couple of weeks. This has a corollary that I’ll address in the part of the question. I managed to (am managing, not quite finished) complete the sprint without undue drama or stress, which is pleasing. Long may it continue ! This being said, I found skeleton to be rather challenging and not intuitive. Lots of effort went in to making something that on the surface seems pretty basic.

As mentioned above, I spent a long time experimenting with my code, a really long time. Whilst I feel I got through the workload I did myself no favours with regards to time-boxing. If the sprint had a larger workload or it was a real life assignment, I would not have faired so well. I also spent to much time grinding through little problems and obstacles when I should probably have made a shout to slack to check to see if anyone was having the same issues, or just knew the solution. I was also not particularly methodical and tended to jump from task to task a bit too much. Ah .. the typing. If I'm not really trying I fall back to staring at the keyboard and although I am now using more than two fingers it’s still not attractive to watch.

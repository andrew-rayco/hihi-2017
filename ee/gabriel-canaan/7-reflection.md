I was happy with the way the week started out and I really felt like I cracked on and and got a lot done. The api task was a great intro to pair programing and I think im going to enjoy doing more.
I had a bit of a speed wobble ( crash ) later on with the agorithmic exercises, and am still working to get up full pace JS-wise. Not to sure what I can do differently to achieve this, other than just more practice.
All good though and still having fun.
